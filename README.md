# FAKE-NEWS-CLASSIFICATION

## Project Statement
This project aims to build a classification model for news articles based on provided 'TRAIN.csv' and 'TEST.csv' files. 'TRAIN.csv' contains labeled news pairs ('title1_en' and 'title2_en') for training, categorized as "Unrelated," "Agreed," or "Disagreed" with existing news. The approach includes data analysis, word cloud creation, data preprocessing, tokenization, stop words removal, and model development using Keras' Functional API. Two models are explored, with 'OSNA_PROJECT2_FINAL' and 'OSNA_PROJ2' Jupyter Notebooks showcasing implementation steps. The objective is to create a code solution that accurately classifies news articles in 'TEST.csv' into predefined categories.

## Solution 
We used two-phase approach. Firstly, it involves extensive data preprocessing and analysis, including stemming, tokenization, and stop words removal. Secondly, it employs Keras' Functional API to create and train a classification model. Two model architectures are explored and evaluated, with Model A identified as the better-performing option. The project aims to deliver a code solution capable of accurately categorizing news articles in the 'TEST.csv' file into predefined categories based on their relationships with existing news stories, facilitating automated news categorization.
